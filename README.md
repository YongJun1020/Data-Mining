Bank Loan Approval Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a bank should approve or deny a loan application. The dataset provided includes various features relevant to loan approval decisions.

Models Used
We will employ the following machine learning models to build and evaluate our prediction system:
 1.	Logistic Regression: A statistical model that estimates the probability of a binary outcome. This model will help us understand the relationship between the features and the likelihood of loan approval.
 2.	Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning model used for classification tasks. It finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space, providing robust classification performance.
 3.	k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a sample based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors. This model will be used to capture the local structure of the data.
 4.	Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, assuming independence between features. This model is particularly effective for large datasets and provides probabilistic predictions.
 5.	Decision Tree: A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks. It splits the dataset into subsets based on feature values, making decisions based on the majority class in each subset.
 6.	Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. It aggregates the results of multiple trees to make a final decision.
 7.	Neural Network: A complex model inspired by the human brain, capable of capturing intricate patterns in the data. We will use this model to explore non-linear relationships between features and loan approval.
